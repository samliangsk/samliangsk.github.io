This paper is about the number 3. The number 4 is left for future work.

* Engineered and developed a software based on Python and Selenium, enabling an automated end-to-end process of initiation, participation, presentation, and termination of video conferencing sessions

* Integrated and deployed a WebRTC QoS and QoE data collection pipeline to UCSB's PINOT, allowing simultaneous curation of dataset on more than 10 programmable end-hosts

* Researched 1,000+ pages of WebRTC protocols, retransmissions, and multiplexing documentations, drawing connections from RFC documentations to real world data, assisted with tools including NumPy, pandas, SQLite, and Matplotlib

* Curated more than 5 TB of data for analysis and helped formulate a research paper
