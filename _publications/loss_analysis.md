A network metrics analysis project instructed by Prof. John Heidemann

* Design and construct over **20** network scenarios incorporating various router algorithms from various simulators, like **Mininet** and **NS-3**, to assess impact on TCP and UDP loss rates under contemporary high-speed conditions
* Automate data generation, collection, and analysis processes, incorporating C socket programming with Mininet, **Traffic control** from the Linux Kernel, **tcpdump**, **dpkg**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**, reducing manual processing time by 40%
* Conduct comparative analysis from different simulations like Mininet and NS-3
