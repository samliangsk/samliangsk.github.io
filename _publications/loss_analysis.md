A network metrics analysis project instructed by Prof. John Heidemann

* Designed and constructed 10000 pipelined network simulations to impact on TCP Reno and BBR loss patterns under Controlled Delay (CoDel) and Fair Queue CoDel (FQ-CoDel) router policies
* Wrote systems that generated data and used Mininet and NS-3 simulators to send packets over simulated links with Active Queuing Management (AQM) policies to a receiver, and analyze results using scapy, pandas, Matplotlib
* Learned TCP congestion control algorithms, C socket programming, and NS-3 through independent research
