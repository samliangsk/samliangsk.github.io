The NSF project led by Prof. Jelena Mirkovic and Prof. Brian Kocoloski.

* Identify and address **1** major security issue (reverse shell root access) and over **3** vulnerabilities in Kubernetes-based Testbed Platform, coordinated with the SPHERE Dev Ops, and mitigated potential risks of unauthorized access and system compromise
* Enhanced scalable data collection and analysis pipeline for Kubernetes based testbed, improving process efficiency by **15%**
* Co-develop 5 testbed sensors with DISCERN researchers, incorporating InfluxDB and PostgreSQL, monitor testbed operation, providing 2 new facets of metrics to monitor malicious activities, improving system security and reliability by 35%
* Establish a **knowledge graph** for the SPHERE testbed, enabling threat and structure visualization, boosting research efficiency by 10% and cut data retrieval time by 40%
* Lower attack surface by more than **15%**, through comprehensive analysis and producing a detailed security report addressing identified vulnerabilities, simulated attacks, and patching suggestions
